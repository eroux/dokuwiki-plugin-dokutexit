This is a cloned repository of the Dokuwiki TeXit plugin
(https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:dokutexit), the original website was
http://danjer.doudouke.org/tech/dokutexit, but the original author has
disapeared, as well as the whole doudouke.org domain (on which he has his mail
address).

The plugin seems to be under GPLv2 license, which I'll assume.
