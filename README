This is a cloned repository of the Dokuwiki TeXit plugin
(https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:dokutexit), the original website was
http://danjer.doudouke.org/tech/dokutexit, but the original author has
disapeared, as well as the whole doudouke.org domain (on which he has his mail
address).

The plugin seems to be under GPLv2 license, which I'll assume.

The plugin supposes you have a recent TeXLive installation (it assumes 2013, but
it should have almost no problem with 2012 version or with MikTeX).

Not that you need to install imagemagick for image conversion.
